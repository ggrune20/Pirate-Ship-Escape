\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 In my game the player is a sailor who is being held captive by pirates on a pirate ship and they need to escape. They need to use a piece of wood to pry open the door to escape the holding cell. From there they combine objects to create a grappling hook that they use to get into the Captain\'92s Quarters. Once they are in the Captain\'92s Quarters they take the bread there and give it to Seamus (the cabin boy) in exchange for his knife. Now, the player attaches the oars to the dinghy boat and cut the straps that drops the boat into the ocean. Finally the player can jump in the dinghy boat to win the game. I learned how to create an NPC and make it possible to talk with the NPC. The Inform7 Handbook, Mr and Mrs. Kiang, and the beta testing were the most helpful.\
